===================================
This file documents the upgrade paths for every mob currently registered in the Universal Mob War mod.
Each mob follows a specific set of upgrade trees based on its "Archetype Tags".

HOW UPGRADES WORK:
1. Points are calculated based on World Day + Kill Count.
2. Mobs spend points on upgrades from ALL their categories in parallel.
3. Example: A Witch [g, nw, pro, witch] will randomly choose between:
   - Increasing Health/Armor (from [g])
   - Increasing Projectile Count (from [pro])
   - Increasing Potion Potency (from [witch])
4. This ensures specialized mobs are well-rounded (tanky AND deadly).
