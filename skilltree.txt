This is skill tree to use fix how it is implemented rn!!!!!

skill point gain per day starts at 0.1 after it hits 10 days then .5 each day instead after 5 days then 1 each day then after 5 days 1.5 each day then after 5 days 3 per day after 5 days 5 per day forever until the mob is max lvl then doesn't add anything, i will say points things will be labeled as poi.

i will refer to p and h, n will have same things as h so all n are basically h
p-passive no fighting by default 
n-neutral needs toggle for neutral to hostile on or something the player does to get attacked by
h-hostile all fighting

The general skill trees below will be applied to even custom mobs from other mods, if that mob ever has the possibility of fighting, eg. has damage per hit amount other then 0, then it goes in g, otherwise gp.

general skill tree(any mobs listed g or not listed in list below will go here) (g): poi 2, until full

healing 1>2>3>4>5
healthboost 1>2>3>4>5>6>7>8>9>10
resis 1>2>3>resis 3 and fire resis 1
invis 1 (10 sec max and only after 1min not invis and 25% chance, tries every 10min>9>8>7>6>5>4>3>2>1>.5>.25
strength 1>2>3>4
shield chance 1 (20%) > 2 (40%) > 3 (60%) > 4 (80%) > 5 (100%)
(enchants: each item that mob has, has 50% drop then 40 then 30 then 20 then 10 then 5% where the lowest chance would be in sync to the max mob tree(if item drops it gets all enchant that r on it, the durability of item goes from max full down to 5% left where the 5% left is synced to when mobs hit the max mob tree

(must get full enchant on that item before getting next tier item(going to next tier clears enchants so you have to get them again).
Progression Paths:
- Standard: Wood -> Stone -> Iron -> Diamond -> Netherite
- Piglin: Gold Sword -> Netherite Sword
- Piglin Brute: Gold Axe -> Netherite Axe
- Drowned: Trident (No tier changes)

(Downgrade Mechanic: If an item breaks (0 durability), it doesn't disappear. Instead, it downgrades to the previous tier (e.g., Netherite -> Diamond) with 0 enchants. If Wood/Gold breaks, it is lost.)

(Armor Upgrades: Each armor piece (Head, Chest, Legs, Feet) upgrades its tier INDEPENDENTLY once its specific enchantments are maxed.)

(each enchant will upgrade random path and you do not need to get done with the current path until going on new one, it's all random)
