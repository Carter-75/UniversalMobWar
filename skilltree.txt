UNIVERSAL MOB WAR - SKILL TREE & POINT SYSTEM
==============================================

💰 CORE CONCEPT: POINT-BASED CURRENCY SYSTEM
Points function like money in an RPG:
  - EARNED from days alive + kills made
  - SPENT on upgrades (each costs points)
  - DEDUCTED from balance when purchased
  - Tracked via spentPoints (running total of spent)
  - Budget = totalPoints - spentPoints

📊 POINT ACCUMULATION FORMULA
Total Points = Day Scaling Points + Kill Scaling Points

Day Scaling (Tiered):
  Days 0-10:  0.1 points/day
  Days 11-15: 0.5 points/day
  Days 16-20: 1.0 points/day
  Days 21-25: 1.5 points/day
  Days 26-30: 3.0 points/day
  Days 31+:   5.0 points/day

Kill Scaling:
  Points = Kill Count × killScalingMultiplier (default 1.0)

Example: Zombie on Day 35 with 100 kills
  Day Points: (10×0.1) + (5×0.5) + (5×1.0) + (5×1.5) + (5×3.0) + (5×5.0) = 56.0
  Kill Points: 100 × 1.0 = 100.0
  TOTAL AVAILABLE: 156.0 points
  
  If mob has spentPoints = 120.0:
    Available to Spend = 156.0 - 120.0 = 36.0 points

  - If empty hand: Add "nw" tag (no weapon upgrades)
  - Archetype: "universal"
Result: Modded mobs work seamlessly with General Tree!

🎯 HOW POINT SPENDING WORKS

1. Mob spawns with point budget (based on day + kills)
2. Every tick (1/20th second):
   a. Check: spentPoints < totalPoints?
   b. Collect all affordable upgrades
   c. SMART SAVING: 50% chance to skip cheap upgrades (<5 pts)
      when expensive ones (>=10 pts) are available
   d. Choose one randomly from filtered list
   e. Apply upgrade immediately
   f. Deduct cost: spentPoints += upgradeCost
   g. Save to PowerProfile NBT
   h. Visual effects (particles, equipment appears)
3. Repeat until spentPoints >= totalPoints (fully upgraded)
4. New kills/days → More points → More upgrades!

SMART SAVING EXAMPLE:
  Available: Health Boost (2 pts), Horde Summon (10 pts)
  50% chance: Skip Health Boost, save for Horde Summon
  50% chance: Buy either upgrade
  Result: Mob sometimes saves for expensive upgrades!

EXAMPLE SPENDING SEQUENCE:
Day 15, 20 kills = 26.5 total points
  Starting spentPoints: 0
  
  Tick 1: Buy Health Boost I (2 pts) → spentPoints = 2.0
  Tick 2: Buy Healing I (1 pt) → spentPoints = 3.0
  Tick 3: Equip Wooden Sword (0 pts) → spentPoints = 3.0
  Tick 4: Buy Sharpness I (3 pts) → spentPoints = 6.0
  Tick 5: Buy Health Boost II (2 pts) → spentPoints = 8.0
  Tick 6: Equip Leather Cap (0 pts) → spentPoints = 8.0
  Tick 7: Buy Protection I (3 pts) → spentPoints = 11.0
  ... continues until spentPoints = 26.5 (fully upgraded)

⚙️ UPGRADE MECHANICS

TIER PROGRESSION:
  - Accumulate 10 enchant levels on item
  - Tier upgrades automatically (e.g., Wood → Stone Sword)
  - Enchant levels reset to 0
  - Continue upgrading new tier

INDEPENDENT SLOTS:
  - Each armor piece upgrades separately
  - Mob can have Diamond Helmet + Iron Chest + Leather Boots

DOWNGRADE ON BREAK:
  - Broken item (0 durability) downgrades one tier
  - Netherite → Diamond → Iron → Stone → Wood → LOST
  - Enchants reset to 0 on downgrade
  - Wood/Gold items destroyed when broken

PIGLIN SPECIAL:
  - Weapon choice based on UUID (deterministic)
  - UUID.hashCode() % 2 == 0 → Sword
  - UUID.hashCode() % 2 == 1 → Bow
  - Always consistent across reloads
